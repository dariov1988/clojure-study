# Clojure Study Examples

A progressive collection of Clojure examples from basic to advanced concepts.

## Project Structure

This project is organized by difficulty and topic:

### Level 1: Basics
- `01-basics.clj` - Syntax, data structures, and basic operations
- `02-functions.clj` - Function definitions and calling
- `03-control-flow.clj` - Conditionals, loops, and control structures

### Level 2: Intermediate
- `04-collections.clj` - Working with lists, vectors, maps, and sets
- `05-higher-order.clj` - Functions as first-class citizens
- `06-sequences.clj` - Lazy sequences and sequence operations

### Level 3: Advanced
- `07-macros.clj` - Macro system and metaprogramming
- `08-concurrency.clj` - Atoms, refs, agents, and core.async
- `09-protocols.clj` - Protocols, records, and multimethods
- `10-advanced.clj` - Advanced patterns and techniques

## Running Examples

### Using Clojure CLI
```bash
# Start a REPL
clj

# Run a specific file
clj -M -m examples.01-basics
```

### Using Leiningen (if installed)
```bash
lein repl
```

## Learning Path

1. Start with `01-basics.clj` to understand Clojure's syntax
2. Move through each file sequentially
3. Experiment by modifying the examples
4. Try solving the exercises at the end of each file
